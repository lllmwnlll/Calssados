# Calssados
IT MEANT TO BE CALÃ‡ADOS NOT CALSSADOS! anyway...
 
Full Changelog and notes... Yeah... i intro it with conclusions.
Update 05/07/2018
A0.4
Concluding: Items are to my likings of balance. The items now appear on Raiders, Traders, Visitors also should appear on drop pods survivors. The militaristic ones will protect very well your feet, since they have around 20hp foot so considering 75% of sharp damage reduction a income of 40dmg will only do 10 dmg only damaging the feet. Toes however may be shotted off at this damage. 

For future updates A0.5:
- Considering station for creation of footwears and handwears. (I may will pool this question)
- C# program it "Feet Shackles" somehow...
- Add new features (not all of those) (spacer handwear, spacer footwear, end-game handwears, footwear)

Removed Features:
- Feet Shackles (I don't feel i should release this feature now, need to work the Csharp on them.)

YOUR FEEDBACK:
I first applied my gameplay style, but i want to know how you guys are doing. So feedback if you think should have changes

Update 03/07/2018 
A0.3
Concluding: It's somehow more balanced, in heat of a battle equip delay is a bitch, but it's very fun. The defense are way way high... But thinking about 5hp for each finger at 75% of defense stopping a bullet with 11 dmg resulting in damage to finger of dmg2,75 to the fingers! Letting them intact... at least.

For future update A0.4:
- Make available for download.
- Apply shackles to prisoners... SOMEHOW...
- Open a Pool (dedicated station to craft handwears and footwears. YES or NOT)
- Check for feedbacks how the mod is doing.

***Yet more Gameplay Test***
- At a pawn in normal conditions (100% health, 100% light) they move 4,61 c/s without "cleats", 5,01 c/s with the faster shoes which is "cleats".
- Tested Chain gloves, Gauntlets, Military boots, metal boots i tweak then a little bit and i think they're good and somehow balanced. Still i need to know if other players agree.
- I didn't have the chance to see if traders, visitors, raiders come with footwear or handwear. Well i could run debug mode to call it a test, but this way i can check for bugs in a normal gameplay and compatibility with other mods.
*Feet Shackles are done and are in mod... Though prisoners don't wear it, your colonists can still wear it... have fun! This because i didn't find a way... YET, to put on prisoners but i having help from the community i may come up with something soon.
*I don't like the art of socks, fingerless gloves, metal boots, military boots, leather boots i may change them.



Update 02/07/2018
Concluding: Review the changes, if they are optimal for gameplay (battle still needs to test)

Ideas for uptade:
simple shackles to bind and slow down prisoners

***Gameplay Test***
Surprise! Surprise! Handwear and Footwear are separated appareals. 
Test crafting: casual shoes, cleats, worker boots, leather boots are too fast;
Test item speed: speed is okay even cleats seems very cool, need to check in a battle so i can determine if OP or no
Test usability: casual shoes can be used with some tweaks

After Test changes maded:
Mass increase
casual shoes:
work to make from 1000 to 2500; added insulation cold 0.10
leather boots:
work to make from 750 to 4000; from armor 0.075 (sharp) to 0.15 ,from 0.15 (blunt) to 0.125; armor multiplier from 0.2 to 0.5
cleats:
work to make from 1800 to 3600
worker boots:
work to make from 1500 to 3000
armor multiplier from 0.1 to 0.3
fingerless:
work to make 1200 to 2400
Armor blunt 0.025 to 0.25; sharp 0.015 to 0.35; multiplier armor 0.1 to 0.3; cold increase to 0.15
generic gloves
work to make from 2000 to 3000; armor (sharp, blunt) from 0.065 to 0.015; armor multiplier from 0.15 to 0.050, cold insulation to 0.01

Military aimed items will be worked on Machine table
While shoes, boots based leather and/or fabric will be tailor

Changes made before testing:
* Change name from "gloves" to "generic gloves"; from "metal gauntlets" to "gauntlets"; from "metal gloves" to "chain gloves"
* Cancel Miner/construction boots, Chef shoes, Farmer Boots. - I don't know a good context to put like. A farm boot design for... farming...
* Suggestion by Nilokka - "fit Monster Hunter RimWorld gloves and boots" - Maybe update? dlc for mod?
* Work on rich descriptions in every item.
* Added Social Gloves idea
Notes for myself:
When working the .XML Check "Name and ParentName" functions

Update 01/07/2018
***First Test***
After testing for the first time some bugs like whitespace at end description
and the correct spelling of Leathery and NOT leathery.

Visually i think the Boots are way bigger that they suppose to be. But they are very cool, i think on keeping it because looks better on Inventory.

But it's working fine. 
This would be A0.1 which includes:
8 footwears - Sandals; Metal Boots; Leather Boots; Socks; Casual Shoes; Worker Boots; Cleats; Military Boots
Planned to A0.2 
Handwears, special boots and gloves.
